Custom Neural Network [Alpha build from VisualTaggy's Experimental Branch 2]
================
This application uses a fully connected neural network with one hidden layer described by Michael Nielsen research paper.Together with input and
output layers the network constitutes three layers. First layer with 784 neurons, second layer with 30 neurons, and the third layer with 10 neurons.
